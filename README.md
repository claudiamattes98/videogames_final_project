# videogames_final_project
github repository for the final project of the Python Course

## documentation
Datasource: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023/ \
I found the dataset on Kaggle via the google datset search https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?src=3&query=video%20games&docid=L2cvMTF0eGoyeDJkYg%3D%3D \
It's an open source dataset created by webscraping backloggd.com \

I chose this dataset because videogames are one of my hobbies and I saw that the data provided could be used to try out a number of ways to work with data in python.
Some of them I already worked a bit with (simple NLprocessing), others I have no experience in (webscraping, geoplotting, plotting in general, maybe some stats, AI prompts).
So, it's more of a personal interest that made me choose the particular dataset, but I'm hoping to train some skills that will be useful for research endeavours in the future. \
